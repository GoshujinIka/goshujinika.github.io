<h1>Test<h1>
<h1>what does this do?? can I use the same thing again??<h1>
<h2>does this work??<h2>
Do I need the thingys??
<h2>idk this seems unnecessary<h2> 
Huh, guess I don't need the "<h1>" stuff. I think its just doing size stuff<h1>
<h2>Why does the latest line never show up until I make a new edit??<h2>
<h2>turns out it can't show that thing in the quotation marks<h2>
<h2>Well I hope thats fixes the problem with the thing making everything big<h2>
<h2>I think I'm filling up the Commit changes thing because I make a new Commit every line<h2>
<h2>why is there no spacing between lines anymore???? does that have something to do with the h1 thingy I made?<h2>
<h2>Well I'm gonna see then...<h2>
<h2>this one line delay whatever is kinda annoying<h2>
<h2>Okay well that worked! I wonder if anyone reading this would be able to understand whats going on lol<h2>
<h2>They can't see whats going on behind the scenes. Also all of this is in the past for them.<h2>


<h2>Soooooo hows your day?..wait you can't answer that........ thats kinda sad to think about<h2>
<h2>ugh the h2 thing is annoying but it stops the lines from merging<h2>
<h2>So far this is pretty hard to read looks really bad but whatever<h2>
<h2>heh well, maybe I'll show this to someone after this line appears which will be when the next line is made because idk<h2>
<h3>okay ignore this line<h3>
<h2>Mehehehehe<h2>
<h5>small??<h5>
<h9>hee hee hoo hoo<h9>
<h2>anyway<h2>
<h2>Ha! you can't even see the line after "small??" I don't think<h2>
<h2>Nevermind it was just working due to the delay<h2>
<h2>wait a minute, the delay thing...Did I fix it??<h2>
<h2> nope<h2>
